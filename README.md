# rgb_game
An easy enough game to test your knowledge of RGB colours.

### HOW IT WORKS?

* On the top appears the RGB color to guess
* In the middle part we have 2 sections
  * First section is **NEW COLORS**, as name says to generate new colors.
  * And the second one is the difficult, we have **EASY** (3 colors) and **HARD** (6 colors)
* On the bottom we have the color squares, in which we should press on the correct one
